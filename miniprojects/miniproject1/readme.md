Mini Project 1 
==============

This is an independent project. In this project you will implement a linear regression solver and 
use the given data to fit a linear regressor. You may choose to use any of the methods that were 
taught in class to fit the regressor. You may choose to use any of the tricks and tips that were 
taught (or perhaps you read up on your own) to solve the regresor as well.  Your regressor must be 
implemented for the structure provided along with the [test script](test_script.py). A script 
similar to the test script will be used (the data created might be from different distributions)
to evaluate your implementation. The lower the rmse score, the higher the grade that you shall 
receive. The API documentation for the test script and other methods are provided with the code 
itself in [napolean](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) 
format, which is popular among most deep learning python programmers and is a common style guide.  
For all the methods that you create, appropriate documentation must be provided in similar style. 


Installation
------------

Run the code ``test_script.py``. Have fun!

Setup
+++++

Use pip insallers to get these packages.

    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy

For those who want to use anaconda distributions of python, use

    conda install numpy
    conda install scipy

Submissions
-----------
Submissions will be handled through ASU blackboard. You must submit all the codes used and 
developed during this project. The codes are expected to run along with the test script as 
specified. If it did not run and produced errors, you will receive no credit for the project. 
	
The code must be handed in with [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) only. 
The code must be written by you. Although you may seek advice from online forums, you shall not 
copy or borrow code from any sources. When in doubt, email the instructor for clarifications on 
borrowing code.		

Academic integrity
------------------

You are expected to maintain the utmost level of academic integrity in the project. Any violation 
of the code of academic integrity will be reported to the dean for official actions. It is an 
academic violation to copy, to include text from other sources, including online sources for both
material and code, without proper citation and licensing. To get a better idea of what constitutes 
plagiarism, consult the 
[ASU policy on student obligations](https://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity/policy). 
This is a serious violation and evidence of plagiarism or academic dishonesty, will likely result
in failing the course and at worse can lead to disqualification from your degree program. Please 
contact the instructor before borrowing material when unsure. Your code might be run through a 
plagiarism checker.
