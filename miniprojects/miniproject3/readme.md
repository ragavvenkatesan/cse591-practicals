Mini Project 2 
==============

This is an independent project.  In this project you will setup the yann toolbox on your machine
and run the 
[multi-layer neural network tutorial]("http://yann.readthedocs.io/en/master/pantry/tutorials/mlp.html").
You will run this with several settings: without any momentum, with Polyak and Nesterov Momentums
with adagrad and rmsprop (you will need to refer other tutorials or the API to figure out how 
to do these). For each of these settings to work efficiently, you need to experiment with various
learning rates and combinations of techniques along with regularizers. Your task is to come up with 
one setting (one file) that will produce the best result as you can best produce.

The submission for this project is a zip file containing a screen shot of the test output of the
base tutorial code, your codes for your best setting and a one-page report. The one-page report will
be typeset in the [camera-ready]("https://www.computer.org/web/tpami/author")
style of IEEE TPAMI.

The report should contain results, analysis and discussion comparing the three network models 
just learnt, difficultiesfaced during these implementations and solutions arrived at for each of 
these difficulties. You will use the mnist dataset generated by cook_mnist_normalized method in 
yann.utils.


Installation
------------

For the yann toolbox installation and other setup details refer the
